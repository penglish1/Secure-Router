Welcome!

The purpose of this blog is to explore existing and developing technologies to keep small (consumer grade) Internet devices more secure. Everyone knows Internet security is a big problem, and large corporate enterprises have expensive options available to them that aren't available to the average consumer. Even if they were available at consumer price points, they are designed to be configured and operated by teams of skilled network engineers.

We think better can be done!
