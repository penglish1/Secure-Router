Internet security is terrible. Everybody knows this. Internet security for consumer devices is worse - usually **much** worse than more expensive devices designed for large corporate enterprises.

But this doesn't have to be true forever. We can have better security for consumer devices.

Where to start?

The router has a *privileged position* on the small office or home office network. Not only is it a networked device, all other network traffic passes through it. This means it can strengthen or weaken the security of other devices attached to it.

This blog is intended to be an exploration of the existing options, and possibilities for a more secure consumer home / small office router.
