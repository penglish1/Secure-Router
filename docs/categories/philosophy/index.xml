      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this blog is to explore existing and developing technologies to keep small (consumer grade) Internet devices more secure. Everyone knows Internet security is a big problem, and large corporate enterprises have expensive options available to them that aren&amp;rsquo;t available to the average consumer. Even if they were available at consumer price points, they are designed to be configured and operated by teams of skilled network engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think better can be done!&lt;/p&gt;
